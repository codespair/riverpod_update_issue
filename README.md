# riverpod_update_issue

Testing using Hooks and Riverpod in a flutter application. Currently have a problem where the screen doesn't update after a context.refresh

what's missing?

This is now solved, check [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67236273/flutter-hooks-riverpod-not-updating-widget-despite-provider-being-refreshed).
